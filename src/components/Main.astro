        A 16 year old from russia who is interested in political geography and
        everything related to it, philosophy and technology. I rarely speak, so
        I'm a bit awkward. Currently my two main goals are to be ready to work
        as a full stack/frontend developer and to improve my English speaking
        skills
      </p>

          At the age of 9 I found countryballs and got into "politics". Of
          course, I actually knew nothing about politics, but it still
          completely changed the direction of my life
        </p>
        <p>
          None of my previous acquaintances and friends were involved in
          politics, so I found new ones online. They were much older than me. In
          such an environment, it’s easy to develop your own vision of life.
          Freedom became my core value, and I began planning to move from russia
          for obvious reasons
        </p>
        <p>
          When I switched my real-life friends to internet ones, I began
          spending a lot of my time on PC and phone, and besides politics I got
          into tech. I still hadn’t thought about becoming a developer, but I
          kept up with the latest tech news and knew a lot of advanced things
          about PCs
        </p>
        <p>
          At the age of 13, I created my first website as a school project,
          because it was the first project I could think of, but I quickly
          forgot about web development. Then I read Atlas Shrugged (because I
          knew I was a libertarian), then started reading non-fiction books in
          general and realized that I am in full control of my future. Now I
          want to leave russia more than ever
        </p>
        <p>
          In the summer of 2024, I started falling in love with web development.
          Not only does it brings me joy, but it can also earn me money to move
          out of russia. That’s why I spend a lot of my time creating websites
          and learning about exciting things!
